## COMPONENTS

AND() - This component performs the logical AND operation between two signals.
OR() - This component performs the logical OR operation between two signals.
NOT() - This component performs the logical NOT operation on a signal.

## INPUTS

1. a (input) - The first input signal.
2. b (input) - The second input signal.
## OUTPUTS

1. x - The result of the AND operation between a and b.
2. y - The result of the NOT operation on signal b.
3. z (output) - The final output, which is the result of the OR operation between x and y. This indicates whether c is the multiplication of a and b.
